# Mini-OS
This project was developed to understand the basic functioning of Operating Systems. 

For this purpose, we have made a command line interpreter which supports most of the vanilla linux terminal commands in interactive as well as batch mode.
We have also programmed a dynamic memory allocator using contiguous memory allocation technique.
